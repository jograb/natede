# Natede by Vitesy API Documentation (unofficial)

[Natede](https://vitesy.com/natede) is a "smart natural air purifier", the successor from [Clairy](https://clairy.com/).
It also has various sensors for measuring the air quality, e. g. temperature and humidity, VOCs, CO and dust. But unfortunately there is no official way to export this data besides the app, so let's expore the API a bit.
